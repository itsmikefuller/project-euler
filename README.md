# ProjectEuler - Mike Fuller

This repository contains code snippets that I have used to solve problems on [ProjectEuler.net](https://www.projecteuler.net). All code is my own.

I find that I can get cracking with many of the problems on ProjectEuler quickly using Python, so you will usually find code snippets in this language. Occasionally I might use other languages for code practice.

Latest solution: [Problem 1 (re-solved in C++)](https://github.com/itsmikefuller/project-euler/blob/main/solved_problems/problem_1/cpp/problem_1.cpp), 2nd November 2024
